## 📊 ROI Analysis

### Cost Investment

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Development Cost** | $15K | 1 week development time |
| **API Cost** | $500/month | Anthropic API calls |
| **Operations Cost** | $200/month | Server and storage |
| **Annual Total Cost** | ~$22K | First year |

### Benefit Analysis

| Benefit Item | Annual Benefit | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| **Labor Savings** | $100K+ | Reduce 2 FTEs |
| **Efficiency Gain** | $50K+ | Fast decision value |
| **Quality Improvement** | $30K+ | Reduce wrong decisions |
| **Annual Total Benefit** | ~$180K+ | Conservative estimate |

### ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Total Benefit - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100%
    = ($180K - $22K) / $22K × 100%
    = 718%

Payback Period = Total Cost / Monthly Benefit
              = $22K / ($180K / 12)
              = 1.5 months
```

**Conclusion**: **ROI 718%**, payback period only **1.5 months** ✅
